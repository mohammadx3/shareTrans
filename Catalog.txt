General Information:
Share MT is the web project
Share MTE is the Enterprise Application
ShareTranEJBNew is the EJB for the application.
ShareManagement.jar and executablesharemanager.jar files are included with this, you will have to import them in your EJB library. Otherwise it will show an exception.

Note: 


While building the Enterprise Application you will encounter an error about exception, 
but you can still run the program without any problems with that error alert. The application
is divided in 2 ways, one you can view without any secure admin login and second is by accessing 
the glassfish https server by click on the link on index page to login as admin. The username and
password for that are admin and password respectively.


Application works Smoothly!


ENJOY!
